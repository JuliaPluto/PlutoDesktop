## Features

- Double click to open files
- No path entering in that input box to move/save a notebook, it happens via a dialog box.
- Multi-window support

... among others.

## Who is this for?

Although everybody is welcome to use this, it is generally focussed on people who are not comfortable
with using CLI. Students and Teachers who are just interested in using Pluto.jl and want to miss the
whole process of installing Julia, then Pluto and then running it and everything, this is what you
are looking for.

## Supported Platforms

- Windows 64 bit only, as of now.

## Installation

- Just download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/JuliaPluto/PlutoDesktop/releases) and get going!
  No need to install ANY other thing. Just install this and you are done!
